[Application Options]

; The alias your node will use, which can be up to 32 UTF-8 characters in
; length.
alias=LNCM Neutrino

; The color of the node in hex format, used to customize node appearance in
; intelligence services.
color=#000000

; The maximum number of incoming pending channels permitted per peer.
maxpendingchannels=3

; Adding an external IP will advertise your node to the network. This signals
; that your node is available to accept incoming channels. If you don't wish to
; advertise your node, this value doesn't need to be set. Unless specified
; (with host:port notation), the default port (9735) will be added to the
; address.
; externalip=

; Instead of explicitly stating your external IP address, you can also enable
; UPnP or NAT-PMP support on the daemon. Both techniques will be tried and
; require proper hardware support. In order to detect this hardware support,
; `lnd` uses a dependency that retrieves the router's gateway address by using
; different built-in binaries in each platform. Therefore, it is possible that
; we are unable to detect the hardware and `lnd` will exit with an error
; indicating this. This option will automatically retrieve your external IP
; address, even after it has changed in the case of dynamic IPs, and advertise
; it to the network using the ports the daemon is listening on. This does not
; support devices behind multiple NATs.
; nat=false

; Specify the interfaces to listen on for p2p connections.  One listen
; address per line.
; All ipv4 on port 9735:
listen=0.0.0.0:9735

; Specify the interfaces to listen on for gRPC connections.  One listen
; address per line.
rpclisten=0.0.0.0:10009

; Specify the interfaces to listen on for REST connections.  One listen
; address per line.
; All ipv4 interfaces on port 8080:
restlisten=0.0.0.0:8080

; Debug logging level.
; Valid levels are {trace, debug, info, warn, error, critical}
; You may also specify <subsystem>=<level>,<subsystem2>=<level>,... to set
; log level for individual subsystems.  Use btcd --debuglevel=show to list
; available subsystems.

; Number of logfiles that the log rotation should keep. Setting it to 0 disables deletion of old log files.
maxlogfiles=3

; Max log file size in MB before it is rotated.
maxlogfilesize=10

; DANGER ZONE! Makes it impossible to restore wallets!

; Control what is allowed for TLS domain names
; Definitely allow localhost
; It is advisable to add your domain in case externalip maps to one
